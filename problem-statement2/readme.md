To automate the execution of health-monitor.sh script on a Linux system, we can use the cron utility.


steps:

crontab -e
*/10 * * * * /path/to/health-monitor.sh





By setting up this cron job, our script will automatically run at the specified intervals, checking the system health and alerting us if any conditions exceed the predefined thresholds.
